# Backend-BicodUp

As part of our Development Platforms project within
the National School of Engineers of Carthage (ENICARTHAGE), we are led to
develop a web application under the theme of E-learning.
This project represents an opportunity that put into practice the theoretical knowledge
acquired during our training and develop them..
